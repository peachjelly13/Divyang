#Project Title: Divyang (Divine Body) - Empowering Education Through Games
Divyang - Our Hackathon Project
People suffering from neurological disorders face significant challenges in society, particularly in the realm of education. These challenges can impact their academic performance, social interactions, and overall educational experience. The gap is even larger in third-world countries, where a segment of society suffering from these disorders may not even be aware of their condition.

Divyang aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the universal language of games to create an inclusive educational platform. Our app uses engaging, interactive games tailored to the unique needs of individuals with neurological disorders. These games are designed to enhance cognitive abilities, improve social skills, and foster a love for learning in a fun, supportive environment.

Divyang transforms education from a daunting task into an enjoyable experience, making learning accessible and effective for those who need it the most. By using adaptive learning techniques and gamification, we empower users to overcome their challenges, build confidence, and achieve their educational goals.

Join us in making a difference in the lives of those who need it most. With Divyang, we can turn the dream of inclusive education into a reality, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to shine, regardless of their neurological challenges.
